            <strong>&lt;Card /&gt; </strong> component. It’s highly likely it shouldn’t be butted right up against any
            other components
            with no
            spacing around it. That’s true for… pretty much every component. So, how do you handle component spacing in
            a
            design system?</p>

          <p class="box-para">I was just writing in my <a href="#">“What’s new in since CSS3?” </a> article about recent
            and possible
            future
            changes to CSS colors. It’s weirdly a lot. There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to define
            colors
            than what we have now. I thought we’d take a really quick look.

            First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it. But here are some aspects:

            Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with that.
            We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that RGB color
            model
            as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a cylinder) but it was
            all
            sRGB gamut.
            With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we’re getting new functions that map that
            color model differently. So I think it’s kind of a double-triple whammy.</p>

          <p class="box-para">A custom <a href="#">favicon</a> is a great way to polish a web project. It displays on
            desktop browser
            tabs, and also inside "save for later" readers, other blog posts linking to your site, and more.
            Traditionally this has been done with the .ico file type, but recently browsers have allowed use of <a
              href="#"> SVG</a>, a
            vector format.</p>
